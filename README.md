# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A user-based **collaborative filtering** system that recommends movies to users based on their ratings and similarities with other users.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project builds a **Movie Recommendation System** that predicts movies a user might like by analyzing the preferences of similar users.  
It calculates **user similarity using cosine similarity** and recommends top-rated movies that a user hasn't seen yet.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [MovieLens 100k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset)  
- **Files used:**
  - `u.data` â†’ User ratings (user_id, movie_id, rating, timestamp)  
  - `u.item` â†’ Movie details (movie_id, title)

## ðŸ”§ What This Project Does
1. Uploads and loads the dataset in **Google Colab**.  
2. Merges **ratings** and **movie titles** into a single dataframe.  
3. Creates a **user-item rating matrix**.  
4. Computes **cosine similarity** between users.  
5. Recommends movies to a user based on ratings from **similar users**.  
6. Evaluates recommendation performance using **Precision@K**.  
7. Generates a **top-5 movie list** for a subset of users.
